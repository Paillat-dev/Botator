Hello!
Here you can find all the informations we store about you & your server when you use botator, and how to delete them and who can access them.
## What informations do we store?
1. Your server's ID
2. Your channel's id (the one you choose in the setup), as well as the models and characters you choose.
4. That\'s it. We will **NOT** store your messages, and any other information.

## Who can access them?
The bot can acces the informations, obviously, but also the developpers, can theoretically acces thoose informations, but none of them will do that.
